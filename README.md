# Pharmacy-Queue-Management-System
This project implements a simple queue-based customer management system for a pharmacy using Python’s collections.deque. Customers can be added to the queue, served in FIFO order, and the current queue can be displayed. The program includes an interactive menu allowing users to manage all operations easily.
